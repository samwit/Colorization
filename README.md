# Colorization using perceptual loss

### The aim is to test using perceptual loss for a colorization model



#### The Results 

Pics can be seen in the Jupyter notebook

Overall the results are pretty good for such a small amount of data and training. Also optimization of the model (loss function mostly) should improve the results if trained on full imagenet set etc

### Next steps to try

- Using Imagenet training set
- Using Resnet50 as the basic model for feature extraction
